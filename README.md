**XART Kernel Source Tree**
_Welcome to the XART Kernel Source Tree! This repository contains the foundational code for the XART kernel. Though still in its early stages, this project has the potential to be a significant contribution to the world of kernel development._

**📂 Repository Structure**

Boot/: This directory contains the bootloader or initialization code needed for the kernel's startup sequence.

XART.kernel/: This is the core of the kernel, where the primary functionalities and system-level operations are likely defined.

**🛠️ Building the Kernel**

While the repository doesn't yet provide explicit build instructions, standard kernel compilation practices should apply. This generally involves configuring the build environment, compiling the source code, and generating the kernel binary.

**📜 License**

At present, the repository does not specify a license. If you need clarification on usage, distribution, or modification rights, please reach out to me directly.

**🤝 Contributing**

Open-source projects thrive on contributions. If you're interested in contributing to the XART kernel, feel free to contact me for guidance on contribution protocols and areas where help is needed.
